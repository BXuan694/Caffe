Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by Berkeley AI Research ([BAIR](http://bair.berkeley.edu))/The Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and community contributors. 

This repo is a modification of my own on Ubuntu18.04LTS + cuda10.0(1080TI) + cuDNN7.6.5 + OpenCV3.4.11
